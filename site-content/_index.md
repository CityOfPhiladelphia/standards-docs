<h2 class="contrast">Why standards are important</h1>
<p>Philadelphiaâ€™s digital standards provide the design, code, and content guidelines for City websites. These standards were created by the Office of Open Data and Digital Transformation for people who are designing, creating, and writing, for the City of Philadelphia. </p>

<p>Many government websites provide an overwhelming amount of information with few cues on how to navigate it. This can cause confusion, frustration, and a feeling of powerlessness for readers. We think Philadelphia can do better.</p>

<p>Government services should be accessible and understandable to everyone. We set out to create standards that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accessible.</li>
  <li>Dignified.</li>
  <li>Effective.</li>
  <li>Human-centered.</li>
  <li>Clear.</li>
  <li>Trustworthy.</li>
</ul>
