The application template was built to provide a less intrusive set of options for application developers.

The only requirement for this template is the Standards Application CSS. You will not need to include the Standards Javascript. The applicaiton template is meant to give developers a trimmed-down version of the standards template. As such, not all of the Foundation CSS is included in this template. For a list of the included Foundation sass, view the <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/standards/blob/master/src/sass/phila-app.scss" class="external">app scss file on GitHub</a>.
