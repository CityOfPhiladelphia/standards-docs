What’s the difference between news, blog posts, and press releases? These are the three types of content your department might release and we want to make it clear which is best.

**News**: Must be new information, presented without opinion.

*Examples: A new law has gone into effect.
The City is shut down for the day because of snow. A new study shows that poverty levels in the city are going down.*

If your department frequently has new information for the public regarding safety, health, services for Philadelphians, or legislation, those updates should be classified as news.

**Blog posts**: Often in the first person, may be related to a news event, or may be more evergreen. Has some opinion, and more personality.

*Examples: Our favorite signs at the DNC. Best place for fish tacos near City Hall. What people really don’t understand about ethics training. Why I love working for the Department of Revenue.*

If your department provides recreational or cultural services, and you want to be able to address the public from a more personal lens, or create evergreen content, then blog posts are the best fit.

**Press releases**: Intended for reporters and members of the press. Designed to encourage enthusiasm and support for a program, event, report, or finding. Includes contact information for relevant experts who might be able to provide further context or support.

*Examples: PCHR Releases Report on Racism and Discrimination in LGBT Community, Philadelphia’s Digital Literacy Alliance Opens Grant Funding Opportunity, Department of Prisons and MOE Team up to Boost Early Literacy*

If your department is frequently looking for press coverage, then press releases are the best fit for you.
