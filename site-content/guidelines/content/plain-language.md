**Write content in clear, simple terms. Avoid wordy descriptions and jargon. **City of Philadelphia websites are for everyone in the City. The content they contain should therefore be as straightforward as possible.

**Don’t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do.** Use *buy* instead of *purchase*, *help* instead of *assist*, *about* instead of *approximately*, and so on.

We lose our users’ trust if we write using government buzzwords and jargon. Often, these words are too general and vague and can lead to misinterpretation or empty, meaningless text. We can do without these words:

* Agenda (unless you’re talking about a meeting)
* Advancing
* Collaborate (use *working with*)
* Combating (use *working against* or *fighting*)
* Commit/pledge (we need to be more specific — we’re either doing something or we’re not)
* Countering
* Deploy (unless you’re talking about the military or software)
* Dialogue (we speak to people)
* Disincentivize (and incentivize)
* Empower
* Facilitate (instead, say something specific about *how* you are helping)
* Foster (unless it's children)
* Illegals/illegal aliens (use *undocumented immigrants*)
* Impact (as a verb)
* Initiate (use *start* or *begin*)
* Innovative (use words that describe the positive outcome of the innovation)
* Land (as a verb, unless you're talking about aircraft)
* Leverage (unless you use it in the financial sense)
* Overarching
* Progress (what are you actually doing?)
* Promote (unless you are talking about an ad campaign or some other marketing promotion)
* Robust
* Streamline
* Strengthening (unless you’re referring to bridges or other structures)
* Tackling (unless you’re referring to football or another contact sport)
* Thought leader (instead, refer to a person’s accomplishments)
* Touchpoint (instead, mention specific system components)
* User testing (unless you’re actually testing the users — otherwise, use *usability testing*)
* Utilize

**Avoid using figurative language.** It often doesn’t say what you actually mean and can make your content more difficult to understand. For example:

* Drive (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
* Drive out (unless you're talking about cattle, use *get rid of*)
* Going forward (unless you’re giving directions)
* In order to (extra words that usually mean the same thing as "to")
* One-stop shop (we’re the government, not a big box store)

In most cases, you can avoid these figures of speech by describing what you’re actually doing. Be open and specific.

**Write conversationally.** Picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-on-one and with the authority of someone who can actively help.

**Avoid gender-specific language whenever possible.**
