### Addresses
When giving addresses spell out the street name entirely, but abbreviate the type of street (St., Rd. Blvd., etc).

>1401 John F. Kennedy Blvd.

### Ampersand
Use an &amp; in labels, headings, and subheadings. Spell out the word "and" in prose, lists, and department or office titles.

### Bulleted lists
Capitalize the first word of every bullet.

>When you go to the store, please buy:

>* *Bread*
* *Milk*  
* *Apples*  

Include a period only if the bullet point makes a complete sentence following the introductory phrase.

>*When you go to the store, please:*

>* *Buy bread, milk, and apples.*
* *Fill the car with gas.*

### Colons
Capitalize the first word after a colon only if what follows is a complete sentence.

>*I have several favorite foods: apples, bananas, and pita chips.*  
*I have several favorite foods: Apples were my first favorite snack, but pita chips are a rising star in my life.*

### Commas
We prefer the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford comma). In a list of three or more, include a comma before the conjunction.

>*Please buy bread, milk, and apples.*

### Dashes
#### Em dash

When offsetting a phrase with dashes, you should use the longer "em dash," with no space on either side of the dash.

WordPress automatically converts 3 consecutive hyphens into an em dash.

>*We emphasize open, digital record keeping, and&mdash;whenever possible&mdash;we illuminate our processes.*

Don't use a single hyphen in place of an em dash.

#### En dash
Although we advocate using words rather than symbols, in some contexts you may use an "en dash" to convey a range. For example, both *10–20 students* and *10 to 20 students* are acceptable options.

The en dash is also used in to show relationships and connections, as in the *Sarbanes&ndash;Oxley Act*, a *JFK&ndash;LAX flight, *or the *Jones--Martin wedding*.

WordPress automatically converts 2 consecutive hyphens into an en dash.

### Dates
Include the full name of the month, as in *December 14, 1954.*

### Quotation marks
Below are examples of correctly punctuated quotations.

>*“Would you like a banana?” he asked.*  
*“I hate bananas,” she said. “You know I hate bananas.”*  
*He paused before saying, “Bananas are not something people should hate.”*

### Semicolons
Use semicolons at the end of bullet points if the list is either inclusive or exclusive.

>Acceptable forms of identification include:

>* Drivers license;
* Birth certificate;
* Or Social Security card.
