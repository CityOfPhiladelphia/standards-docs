{{% filter-item Ampersand %}}
Use an “&” in labels, headings, and subheadings. Spell out the word “and” in prose, lists, and department or office titles.
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item Brackets %}}
Brackets are used to indicate that the writer has replaced the original word in quoted text with a different word to clarify the speaker’s intended meaning.
{{% /filter-item %}}


Example: She attended [graduate] school.

Example: He sat in on [several courses] during his day visiting the university.

{{% filter-item Bulleted lists %}}

Capitalize the first word of every bullet. Include a period only if the bullet point makes a complete sentence following the introductory phrase.

Example: When you go to the store, please buy:

* Bread.
* Milk.
* Apples.  
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Capitalization %}}
Unnecessary capitalization can come off as overly formal and unapproachable. We follow these capitalization guidelines:

 * Don’t capitalize “federal” or “government.”

Example: Working for the federal commission was very rewarding.

Example: City government makes important decisions.

* Don’t capitalize a job title unless it directly precedes a proper name.

Example:. Write to Chief Technical Officer, Jane Doe.

Example: Write to the chief technical officer.

 * Do capitalize the word city when referring to the City of Philadelphia as an official organization.

Example: The City will announce pool openings on Friday.

Example: There are several City employees at the event.

* Don’t capitalize “city” when it is used in an inclusive or general sense.

Example: Philadelphia was selected as the host city for the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

* In titles, do not capitalize coordinate conjunctions (for example, “and,” “but,” “or”); or prepositions with four or fewer letters.

* Do capitalize proper nouns.

Examples:  Pennsylvania, World War II, Acme Explosives Company
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Colons %}}

Capitalize the first word after a colon only if what follows is a complete sentence.

Example:  I have several favorite foods: apples, bananas, and pita chips.

Example:  I have several favorite foods: Apples were my first favorite snack, but pita chips are a rising star in my life.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Commas %}}

We prefer the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford comma). In a list of three or more, include a comma before the conjunction.

Example: Please buy bread, milk, and apples.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Contractions %}}
Standard English contractions ( for example., “we’ll,” “ you’ll,” “won’t,” “don’t,” “haven’t”) are acceptable – even encouraged – in informal web content, but not in proposals or statements of work, where you should use  a more formal tone.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Dashes %}}

Different types of dashes are used in different situations

* Em dash: An em dash is a long dash. Use an Em dash to set off a phrase. Don’t use a single hyphen in place of an em dash.

Example: We emphasize open, digital record keeping, and—whenever possible—we illuminate our processes.

* En dash: An en dash is shorter than an em dash. Use an en dash to convey a range. The en dash is also used in to show connected items. Don’t use  a single hyphen in place of an  en dash.

Example: The program is open to children ages 10-12.

Example: He referred to the Sarbanes–Oxley Act.

See also “hyphen.”

**To make an Em-Dash**

* Mac: Option + shift + hyphen
* Windows: Alt + 151 (#pad)
* WordPress: Three consecutive hyphens

**To make an En-Dash**

* Mac: Option + hyphen
* Windows: Alt + 150 (#pad)
* WordPress: Two consecutive hyphens

{{% filter-item Ellipses %}}

Ellipses indicate things left unsaid. They are often used to shorten quoted material, removing irrelevant words without changing the meaning.
Unless used to shorten a quote, write around them as much as possible. If they are absolutely necessary, they should be treated as a word, with spaces before and after.

Example: “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.”

“Ask not what your country can do … your country.”
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Hyphen %}}

The hyphen indicates conjunction and has three uses:

* To distinguish between homographs

Example: re-dress = dress again

Example: redress = remedy or fix

* To link certain prefixes with their main word

Example: non-planar

Example: sub-achiever

* Use a hyphen when the letters brought together:

 * Are the same

  * Are vowels

 * Form an uncommon word

 * May be misread


* To link related terms in compound adjectives and adverbs.

* Use a hanging hyphen when two compound adjectives are separated

Example: three- and four-digit numbers

Example: a ten-boat or -vessel regatta

* Hyphenate two-word numbers from 21 to 99 when presented as words

Example: sixty-six

* Hyphenate fractions

Example: six-eighths

* Do not hyphenate other multi-word numbers

Example: two hundred (not two-hundred)

* Hyphenate values and units as compound adjectives if the unit is given as a whole word

Example: (9-millimetre gun)

* Where hyphens are not used, always separate values and units by a non-breaking space

Example: 9 mm gun

{{% filter-item Parentheses %}}

Unless used to introduce an acronym for the first time, these tend to distract from the flow of a sentence and should be avoided in favor of commas and dashes.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Periods and spaces %}}

Do not separate acronyms with periods or blank spaces

Examples: GOP, NASA, OBE, GmbH

* Many periods and spaces that were traditionally required have now dropped out of usage

Example: “PhD” is preferred to  “Ph.D.”

* Truncated (“Hon.” for “Honorable”), compressed (“cmte.” for “committee”) and contracted (“Dr.” for “Doctor”) abbreviations may or may not be closed with a period.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Plurals of lowercase letters %}}

Use apostrophe + s to form plurals of lowercase letters.

Example: Don’t forget to dot your i’s.

What about plural of uppercase letters, like acronyms?  There is no need for apostrophes indicating a plural on capitalized letters, numbers and symbols.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Quotation marks%}}

Below are examples of correctly punctuated quotations:

* “Would you like a banana?” he asked.

* “I hate bananas,” she said. “You know I hate bananas.”

* He paused before saying, “Bananas are not something people should hate.”

Quotation marks should NOT be used to indicate emphasis or emotion, nor should they be used to set off proper names.

Example: Get ready for hurricane season. NOT: Get ready for “hurricane season.”

Example: NOT: We are currently understaffed but we will “do our best” to get to your concern in a timely manner.

Example: NOT: Joe Johnson became the head of the “Department of Human Affairs” in June 1999.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Semicolons%}}

Use semicolons at the end of bullet points.

Example: Acceptable forms of identification include:

* Driver’s license;
* Birth certificate;
* Or Social Security card.
