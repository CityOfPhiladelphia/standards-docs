Use common contractions like *it's, can’t, shouldn't,* and *you'll*. Contractions are part of everyday conversation, so readers find them easy to understand.

Too many uses of *it is, cannot,* and *should not* can seem archaic and formal. We can move away from this without compromising the reliable and professional tone of information coming from government.
