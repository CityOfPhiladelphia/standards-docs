Embrace the City’s writing style by adopting our preferred words, phrases, and standards.


{{% filter-item Acronyms and abbreviations %}}

The first time you refer to an organization or project that uses an acronym, write out the full name and follow with the abbreviation in parentheses.

* **Example:** The General Services Administration (GSA) oversees the business of the U.S. Federal Government.

Some names are more recognizable when they are abbreviated, as with IBM and FBI.

In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable and you don’t need to spell out the full name at first use.

#### If possible, use a shortened version of the name, and not the acronym, in your second reference.
Use a shortened name instead of an acronym when making a second reference to something with a long title. Readers can understand a shortened name without having to think about the first reference. This also helps prevent confusion between identical or similar acronyms.

* **Example:** Use Parks & Rec. instead of PPR.
* **Example:** Use the Act instead of Fire and Police Employee Relations Act.
* **Example:** Use Commerce in place of Department of Commerce, rather than DOC.
* **Example:** Use Corrections in place of Department of Corrections, rather than DOC.

Only use abbreviations without any explanation if they are in common use among the targeted readership (e.g., ZIP code, HTML, CSS PDF, URL and, in some cases, IT).

Acronyms should be capitalized. Otherwise, avoid unless they make the text easier to read.

* **Example:** ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan.

Do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an acronym.

* **Example:** Did you receive the PDFs?

{{% filter-item "Active vs. passive voice" %}}

Use active voice, not passive voice, whenever possible.
Active voice makes it immediately clear who or what is performing an action.
* **Example:** The mayor recommends that City residents take shelter before the winter storm.

Passive voice describes a sentence that doesn’t state who or what is responsible for an action, or puts the “do-er” later in the sentence than the thing being done.

* **Example:**  It is recommended that City residents take shelter before the winter storm.
* **Example:** A recommendation was made by the mayor to take shelter before the winter storm.

While readers usually prefer active voice, there are situations where passive voice is useful. This includes times when the acting person or thing is actually unknown, or when you want to draw attention to the object being acted upon.

* **Example:** The motorcycles were stolen late last night.
NOT: Someone stole the motorcycles late last night.



{{% filter-item Addresses %}}
When giving addresses spell out the street name entirely, but abbreviate the type of street (St., Rd., Blvd., etc).

* **Example:** 1401 John F. Kennedy Blvd.
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item "Capital / capitol" %}}
Use “capitol” when referring to a building.

* **Example:** After speaking with Governor Wolf, representatives returned to the capitol.

Use “Capitol” only when referring to the building in Washington, DC.

* **Example:** We took a field trip to the Capitol.

Use “capital”  for talking about the official seat of a  government,  for talking about wealth or assets,  or for a capital letter.

* **Example:** Harrisburg is the capital of Pennsylvania.
* **Example:** It takes capital to start your own business.
* **Example:** Begin proper nouns with a capital letter.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item "Citizen" %}}
Since some of those people living within the City might not be citizens, we prefer to use residents or individuals.  
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item "Dates" %}}

Use numbers for dates and years.

Don’t use st, nd, rd, or th.

When you use months with a date, only abbreviate the following months: Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec.

* **Example:** The Phillies’ opening day is April 8.
* **Example:** The first day of school will be Wednesday, Sept. 9 this year.

You don’t need to use a comma if only a year and month are given.

* **Example:** I began my job in December 2017.


You do need a comma when date, month, and year are given.

* **Example:** Philadelphia was founded on Oct. 27, 1682.

Capitalize days of the week and do not abbreviate.

* **Example:** Mayor Kenney will be speaking at the event on Thursday.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item "e-" %}}
Use e-, with a hyphen, to abbreviate electronic

* **Example:** e-book, e-commerce

Exception – email
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item "Emigrate from / immigrate to" %}}
Emigrate means to leave one country or region to settle in another.

* **Example:** In 1900, my grandfather emigrated from Russia.

Immigrate means to enter another country and reside there.

* **Example:**  Many Mexicans immigrate to the United States to find work.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item "Figurative language" %}}
Avoid using figurative language. It often doesn’t say what you actually mean and can make your content more difficult to understand.
For example:

* Drive (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
* Drive out (unless you’re talking about cattle, use “get rid of”)
* Going forward (unless you’re giving directions)
* In order to (extra words that usually mean the same thing as “to”)
* One-stop shop (we’re the government, not a big box store.)
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item "Historic / historical" %}}
In general usage, historic refers to what is important in history.

* **Example:**  A historic summit meeting between the prime ministers

Historical applies more broadly to whatever existed in the past, whether it was important or not.

* **Example:**  The City eliminated the Department of Horse and Buggies, a historical department, in 1909.  
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item "Inclusive language" %}}
The City of Philadelphia uses language that is inclusive regardless of age, ancestry, color, disability, domestic or sexual violence victim status, ethnicity, familial status, gender identity, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation. To that end, we always write with a person-first perspective.

#### Age
Unless it is important for the reader to know, don’t reference a person’s age.

#### Disability

When writing about those with disabilities, we use people-first language.

* **Example:** Children with Cerebral Palsy have benefited from the program.

We also make sure that any disability is correctly identified.

* **Example:** The program serves over 3,000 individuals who are classified with a spectrum disorder.
  * NOT: The program serves over 3,000 autistic people.

#### Hearing
Use the term “deaf” as an adjective to describe those with significant hearing loss. You can also use the term “partially deaf” or “hard of hearing” for those with less significant hearing loss.

#### Vision

A person without vision is blind. A person with some vision can be “legally blind” or can be identified as having “low vision.”

#### Gender and sexuality
Whenever possible, use neutral language for titles.

* **Example:** Chairperson, firefighter, police officer.

#### LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender)

Refer to the LGTB or LGBTQ community as a single acronym. As with all abbreviations, spell it out at first use and use the acronym thereafter.

* **Example:** Jones has long been a champion of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community and reaffirmed his commitment in a the speech on Thursday.

Use the following as adjectives, but never as nouns:

  * lesbian
  * gay
  * bisexual
  * transgender
  * trans
  * LGBT/Q

It is acceptable, when applicable, to use the non-gendered pronoun, “they” as a singular.

#### Mental and physical conditions
When referencing mental or physical conditions, do not refer to an individual as “mentally ill.” Instead, if warranted, you may use the same rules as for those with disabilities.

* **Example:** The Center was created to assist those with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and severe depression.
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item  "Login / log in" %}}
One word when used as a noun or adjective.

* **Example:** What’s your login name?

Two words when used as a verb.

* **Example:** Hurry up and log in!
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item  "Measurements" %}}
Use English units of measure (e.g., foot, mile, gallon and pound). Spell out units of measure, except after numbers, where abbreviations (e.g., ft., lb., m.p.g.) may be used. Avoid the use of measurement symbols (e.g., # for pound), including in tables.

* **Example:** 23 ft. high
* **Example:** 6 ft. 2 in.
* **Example:** 144 sq. ft.
* **Example:** 12 ft. x 12 ft.
* **Example:** price per pound
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item  "Names" %}}
Use the [City government directory](https://beta.phila.gov/departments/) to find the official name of an office, department, or commission. Use that name consistently.

* **Example:** Department of Revenue
  * NOT: Revenue Department

After the first reference on a page use the shortened name.

* **Example:** File your City taxes with the Department of Revenue. If you have trouble paying your taxes, Revenue has a variety of assistance programs.

For people, on initial mention, use First Name Last Name. Subsequent mentions use only last name. If two individuals in a story have the same last name, use First Name Last Name in every instance.

* **Example:** John Jones said that city government is the most fulfilling job he’s ever had. Jones joined his department in 1994.

John Jones and Casey Jones say their work in city government is essential. John Jones joined his department in 1994. Casey Jones began her work with the City in 2001.
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item  "Numbers" %}}
Spelling out numbers one through nine; use numerals beyond that (10, 11, etc.).

#### Spell out a number when it:

Occurs at the start of a sentence.

* **Example:** Twenty minutes later, the last cyclist crossed the finish line.

Is a fraction used as an estimate.

* **Example:** one-half, two-thirds, three-quarters

#### Use digits instead of spelling out a number when it:

  * Includes a decimal point.

* **Example:** At that time, the average age for marriage was just 18.7 years old.

Is part of a percentage

* **Example:** 19 percent of registered voters

Is part of a range of numbers

* **Example:** the coveted 18–34 demographic; working 9 to 5

#### Ages
Always use digits to express ages.

* **Example:** 5 years old

#### Decimal points
Use a leading zero (0.05, not .05) for numbers between minus one and plus one. Use a consistent number of decimal places within a document.

#### Fractions
Spell out and hyphenate all numbers less than one.

* **Example:** one-half, two-thirds

Separate fractions from a preceding whole number with a space.

* **Example:** 5 ½

#### Measurement
Always use figures in measurements.

* **Example:**  5 feet by 20 feet

#### Money
Use the dollar sign ($) for amounts given in United States Dollars (USD). For fractional amounts under $1.00 that do not occur in a chart or list, use digits for the number and spell out the word “cents.”

#### Example
Project estimates are expected to exceed $289.5 million after the storm damage is assessed.

* **Example:** In 2014, the cost of producing a penny dropped to 1.7 cents, down from 2.4 cents in 2011.

#### Percentages
Use digits rather than spelling out the number and spell out the word “percent” (one word) when including percentages in prose writing. Use the percentage sign (%) when including percentages in charts, lists, and brief summaries.

* **Example:** The study showed a 5 percent decrease in obesity rates among students aged 5 to 18.
* **Example:** Late fee: 5% of the total due, plus an additional 0.5% for every month the bill is not paid.

#### Phone and fax numbers
Use parentheses and a space to separate the area code from the rest of a phone or fax number. Use a hyphen (-) between the third and fourth digits that follow the area code.

* **Example:** Call (215) 686-0306 to find out if the building where you live is being managed by a court-appointed receiver.
* **Example:** You can pay delinquent property taxes with a credit card by calling (877) 309-3710.

#### Ranges
Use “to” when constructing number ranges within sentences. An en dash may be used in place of “to” outside of sentences to save space.

* **Example:** 20 to 30 days
* **Example:** Hours 5–8 p.m.

#### Ratios
Use figures and hyphens. Include the word "to" unless the number immediately preceded the word “ratio.”

* **Example:** The ratio was 2-to-1, a 2-1 ratio and a ratio of 2-to-1.

#### Years
Do not use an apostrophe when pluralizing years.

* **Example:** 1900s

See the “numerals” entry in [AP Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) for complete guidance.
