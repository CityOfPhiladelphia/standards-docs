We’re here to assist people in becoming empowered residents of the city. We do this through the design of the digital experience, but also through the language we use to communicate with the public and with each other.

**The City's voice**,
along with standards for formatting, punctuation, and common usage, help maintain consistent content throughout [beta.phila.gov](www.beta.phila.gov).



### Keep the following in mind as you write for the web:


* **Use plain language**: City of Philadelphia websites are for everyone in the City. Write content in clear, simple terms. Avoid wordy descriptions and jargon. Use [HemingwayApp](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), an online tool to make your writing clear and concise.

* **Don’t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do.**

* **Write conversationally**: Picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-on-one and with the authority of someone who can actively help. Using contractions can help create a friendly, informal tone as well. [Plainlanguage.gov](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/) offers helpful tips. 

* **Write for diverse audiences**: We write for a diverse audience of readers who all interact with our content in different ways. We aim to make content accessible to those with disabilities and to users of all cognitive capabilities. We use language that isn’t exclusionary and is nondiscriminatory. See the entry on [Inclusive language](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/standards-docs/blob/master/site-content/guidelines/content/common-usage.md) in the common usage section of this guide.

* **Be goal-oriented & appropriate**: Before you start writing, ask: What purpose does this serve? What do people need to know? Do I give them the information using language that appropriately reflects my department?

* **[Write in active voice](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/standards-docs/blob/master/site-content/guidelines/content/common-usage.md)**

* **Be helpful**: We want to always use a tone that has authority that also comes from a helpful, empathetic perspective. 

* **Think resident-focused**: Always write with the audience in mind. How might someone needing Parks and Recreation services have different needs and stress levels than someone in touch with the Department of Human Services?  Understanding the audience helps our communications maintain a human-centered approach that treats those who use city services with dignity.


* **Make sure you're accurate and complete**: Communications should give the user the information they need and that information should be current and correct. Always remember to fact check your work! Offer a means of contact for more information. Don’t create a communications dead end.
