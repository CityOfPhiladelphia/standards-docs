Use red alerts for critical and unexpected events.

 * Phones are not working
 * An office had to close for weather-related reasons
 * A regular service is suspended.

Use yellow alerts for warnings.

 * SEPTA service will be delayed two hours.


Use green alerts to show that service is continuing as usual.

You have one sentence for an alert. Begin with what is affected. Then what is happening. Then how long it will be going on. If you don’t know how long it will be going on, don’t include a time frame.

If there is a url where users can go to get more information, include a link in a second sentence. Don’t use the phrase “click here.”

If you know how long the thing will be going on, you can include that information in a third sentence. Here are three possible formats:

 * *[Single Date]* In Effect: July 26, 2016
 * *[Multiple Dates]* In Effect: July 26 - 28, 2016 - or- In Effect: July 25, 2016 & July 30, 2016
 * *[Dates & Time]* In Effect: From 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on July 26, 2016
