We’re here to assist people in becoming empowered residents of the city. We do this through the design of the digital experience, but also through the language we use to communicate with the public and with each other. 

**Our guiding principles**
along with standards for formatting, punctuation, and common usage, will help  us maintain consistent content throughout [beta.phila.gov](www.beta.phila.gov)

### Our Guiding Principles

In all communications that you create for the website, please write with the following in mind and try to make your writing: 

### Accessible


* **Plain language**: City of Philadelphia websites are for everyone in the City. Write content in clear, simple terms. Avoid wordy descriptions and jargon. 

  * Use [HemingwayApp](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), an online tool to make your writing clear and concise. 

  * Also consider: Don’t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do. 

  * Avoid figurative language. In most cases, you can avoid these figures of speech by describing what you’re actually doing.
 
  * Be open and specific.
  * Write conversationally. 

  * Picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-on-one and with the authority of someone who can actively help. 
  * Using contractions can help create a friendly, informal tone as well. 

* **Diverse audiences**: We write for a diverse audience of readers who all interact with our content in different ways. 

  * We aim to make content accessible to those with disabilities and to users of all cognitive capabilities. 
  * We use language that isn’t exclusionary and is nondiscriminatory. See the entry on Inclusive language in the common usage section of this guide.

### Effective

* **Goal-oriented & appropriate**: 
Before you start writing, ask: What purpose does this serve? What do people need to know? Do I give them the information using language that appropriately reflects my department? 

* **Active**: Use active voice whenever possible. 

### Dignified & human-centered

* **Helpful**: We know that when people help us, it instantly makes us feel better, even if we don’t get exactly what we initially wanted. Similarly, when people are unhelpful, it sets up a negative interaction where, no matter what the outcome, we often come away with a bad impression. Because of this, we want to always use a tone that has authority, but that also comes from a helpful, empathetic perspective. Not only is this the nice thing to do, but in the end, it will make our jobs easier.

* **Resident-focused**: Always write with the audience in mind. How might someone needing Parks and Recreation services have different needs and stress levels than someone in touch with the Department of Human Services? 
   * Understanding the audience helps our communications maintain a human-centered approach that treats those who use city services with dignity. 

### Clear & trustworthy

* **Provide context**: A paragraph of text that provides some background for the information helps users determine if what they are reading is relevant to their needs. 
   * Ask: What is this related to? Who would need this? Be sure to link back to related pages that will give more information for complex topics

* **Accurate**: Communications should give the user the information they need and that information should be current and correct. Always remember to fact check your work!

* **Complete**: Always offer a means of contact for more information. This creates a responsible party and builds trust and a sense of effectiveness. Offer a next steps or a way to get more information if the individual  is lost. Don’t create a communications dead end.
