Use these rules for punctuation and formatting content.


{{% filter-item Ampersand %}}
Use an “&” in labels, headings, and subheadings. Spell out the word “and” in prose, lists, and department or office titles.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Block capitalization %}}
DON’T USE CAPITAL LETTERS FOR LONGER HEADLINES OR BLOCKS OF TEXT. IT’S HARD TO READ AND CAN SEEM LIKE “SHOUTING.”
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Block quotes %}}
Use block quotes when you want to highlight a single sentence or phrase from within the body of your writing. Block quotes use text format and placement to highlight a particular issue so readers who scan can get the most important nugget from the story. Use block quotes sparingly to create the biggest impact.

* **Example:**
“We are changing the way the City website serves our residents” - Office of Open Data and Digital Transformation
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item Brackets %}}
Brackets are used to indicate that the writer has replaced the original word in quoted text with a different word to clarify the speaker’s intended meaning.

* **Example:** She attended [graduate] school.
* **Example:** He sat in on [several courses] during his day visiting the university.
{{% /filter-item %}}





{{% filter-item Calendar %}}
Use Google calendar to set up your calendar events.
Use the [Dates]section of the common usage guide to check your use of date, time, place, and abbreviations.
All-day events taking place on the same day should be entered all together. Use an ampersand (&) before the last item in the list, and do not use a serial comma.

* **Example:** Monthly payment due for Wage, Hotel, Outdoor Advertising, Parking, Valet Parking & Vehicle Rental Taxes
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Capitalization %}}
Unnecessary capitalization can come off as overly formal and unapproachable. We follow these capitalization guidelines:

#### Don’t capitalize “federal” or “government.”  

* **Example:** Working for the federal commission was very rewarding.
* **Example:** City government makes important decisions.

#### Don’t capitalize a job title unless it directly precedes a proper name.

* **Example:** Write to Chief Technical Officer, Jane Doe.
* **Example:** Write to the chief technical officer.

#### Do capitalize the word city when referring to the City of Philadelphia as an official organization.

* **Example:** The City will announce pool openings on Friday.
* **Example:** There are several City employees at the event.

#### Don’t capitalize “city” when it is used in an inclusive or general sense.

* **Example:** Philadelphia was selected as the host city for the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

In titles, do not capitalize coordinate conjunctions (for example, “and,” “but,” “or”); or prepositions with four or fewer letters.

#### Do capitalize proper nouns.

* Examples:  Pennsylvania, World War II, Acme Explosives Company
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Colons %}}
Capitalize the first word after a colon only if what follows is a complete sentence.

* **Example:**  I have several favorite foods: apples, bananas, and pita chips.
* **Example:**  I have several favorite foods: Apples were my first favorite snack, but pita chips are a rising star in my life.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Commas %}}
We prefer the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford comma). In a list of three or more, include a comma before the conjunction.

* **Example:** Please buy bread, milk, and apples.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Contractions %}}
Use common contractions like it’s, can’t, shouldn’t, and you’ll. Contractions are part of everyday conversation, so readers find them easy to understand.

Too many uses of it is, cannot, and should not can seem archaic and formal. We can move away from this without compromising the reliable and professional tone of information coming from government.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Dashes %}}
Different types of dashes are used in different situations.

#### Em dash
An em dash is a long dash. Use an Em dash to set off a phrase. Don’t use a single hyphen in place of an em dash.

* **Example:** We emphasize open, digital record keeping, and—whenever possible—we illuminate our processes.
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item Emphasis %}}
**Bold** calls attention to key information.

_Italics_ are used under specific conditions, such as to indicate the title of a book. Avoid using italics to emphasize an idea or to create a sarcastic tone.

Underlining should not be used in web communications, as this can be reserved to indicate a link.
{{% /filter-item %}}



{{% filter-item En dash %}}

An en dash is shorter than an em dash. Use an en dash to convey a range. The en dash is also used in to show connected items. Don’t use  a single hyphen in place of an  en dash.

* **Example:** The program is open to children ages 10-12.
* **Example:** He referred to the Sarbanes–Oxley Act.

See also “hyphen.”

**To make an Em-Dash**

* Mac: Option + shift + hyphen
* Windows: Alt + 151 (#pad)
* WordPress: Three consecutive hyphens

**To make an En-Dash**

* Mac: Option + hyphen
* Windows: Alt + 150 (#pad)
* WordPress: Two consecutive hyphens
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Ellipses %}}
Ellipses indicate things left unsaid. They are often used to shorten quoted material, removing irrelevant words without changing the meaning.
Unless used to shorten a quote, write around them as much as possible. If they are absolutely necessary, they should be treated as a word, with spaces before and after.

* **Example:** The sign said "no eating, drinking, or smoking,” becomes, _The sign said "no ... smoking."_
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item Headings %}}
Use Headings to break up content into sections. Headlines, page titles, subheads, and similar content should follow sentence capitalization rules.

* **Example:** How to pay your taxes.
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item Hyphen %}}
The hyphen indicates conjunction and has several uses:

#### To link certain prefixes with their main word

Use a hyphen when the letters brought together:

* Are the same
* Are vowels
* Form an uncommon word
* May be misread

#### To link related terms in compound adjectives and adverbs.

Use a hanging hyphen when two compound adjectives are separated

* **Example:** three- and four-digit numbers

---

Hyphenate two-word numbers from 21 to 99 when presented as words

* **Example:** sixty-six

Hyphenate fractions

* **Example:** six-eighths

Do not hyphenate other multi-word numbers

* **Example:** two hundred (not two-hundred)

See also "Dashes."



{{% filter-item Links %}}
Links are most effective when they are specific and descriptive. When you create a link, highlight text that will give users a clear idea of what they will see if they follow the link. This is especially useful for people with vision impairments who use screen readers, and will often skip from one link to another as a way of skimming content.

* **Example:** To be ready for the unexpected, you and your family need to [make an emergency plan](https://beta.phila.gov/services/safety-emergency-preparedness/prepare-for-an-emergency/make-an-emergency-plan/).
  * NOT: To be ready for the unexpected, you can find out how to create an emergency plan [here](https://beta.phila.gov/services/safety-emergency-preparedness/prepare-for-an-emergency/make-an-emergency-plan/).

#### No “click here”

Do not use “click here” as the label for any link. Since “click here” is not descriptive, it’s harder for people to find the linked content through a search engine. It’s also becoming an outdated term, since mobile devices involve tapping, not clicking.

#### Link destinations

When you create a link, think about where you are sending the user and why. Check to make sure that you have picked the most relevant and authoritative destination so users will get the best information available as quickly as possible. For example, if the Department of Health issues a statement that you are citing, link to the Health statement, rather than to an outside news story that quotes the statement.

You should also be consistent when determining what will happen when someone follows a link. Phila.gov follows these guidelines for opening new tabs or windows in a user’s browser:

#### Do not automatically open new tabs or windows
Do not set a link to open a new browser tab or window. This applies to any web page link, whether the link goes to another phila.gov page or to an external website.*

* Example: For additional information on emergency preparedness and response measures, visit the <a href="https://www.fema.gov/" class="external">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)</a> website.

#### Do automatically open new tabs if the link will begin a process
If the link will begin a new process (for example, starting a registration process for a license, paying a bill, or ordering something), do set the link to open in a new tab. This allows people to complete that new process while still referencing the original page.

#### Link to document pages, not directly to PDFs
When linking to a form or document, link to the document page that houses that form, rather than directly to the form. Document pages provide important context for files, group related forms together, and are regularly reviewed and updated.


#### Indicate when linking to a website outside of phila.gov
When you are linking to a website outside of phila.gov check the box that indicates that this website is not part of phila.gov. This helps users know they’ll be going to a new website, not a different page on phila.gov. For more information visit [technical details on linking](/use/technical-details/css-architecture/#class-names).

#### Repetitive links
Excessive linking can be confusing and overwhelming. If a resource, topic, or organization is referenced multiple times on one page you only need to link to it the first time. For example, if you refer to the Office of Property Assessment three times in a content item, link to it the first time but not the second or third times.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Lists %}}

There are two types of lists: bulleted and numbered. Bulleted lists are known as “unordered” on the web, and numbered lists are known as “ordered.” Most lists should be unordered. Only use an ordered list if the order or number of items matters, as in a list of steps.

**Bulleted lists**
Capitalize the first word of every bullet. Include a period only if the bullet point makes a complete sentence following the introductory phrase.

* **Example:** When you go to the store, please buy:
  * Bread.
  * Milk.
  * Apples.  
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item PDFs %}}
Usability expert Jakob Nielsen explains that [PDFs are good for distributing documents and forms that need to be printed] (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pdf-unfit-for-human-consumption/). However, PDFs have several limitations.

PDFs are:

* Hard to read on computer and mobile screens.
* Not always accessible to people with disabilities.
* Not easily shared on social media.

For these reasons, PDFs shouldn’t be used for content that you want people to read online. 
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Parentheses %}}
Parentheses are used to set off non-essential information in a sentence.

* **Example:** The director (and the deputy director) attended the gala.

Parentheses are also used to set off area codes in phone numbers. Type one space after the area code in parentheses.

* **Example:** (215) 867-5309 
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item Periods and spaces %}}
Do not separate acronyms with periods or blank spaces.

Examples: GOP, NASA, OBE, GmbH

Many periods and spaces that were traditionally required have now dropped out of usage.

* **Example:** “PhD” is preferred to  “Ph.D.”

Truncated (“Hon.” for “Honorable”), compressed (“cmte.” for “committee”) and contracted (“Dr.” for “Doctor”) abbreviations may or may not be closed with a period.

Type only one space after a period.

{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Plurals of lowercase letters %}}
Use apostrophe + s to form plurals of lowercase letters.

* **Example:** Don’t forget to dot your i’s.

What about plural of uppercase letters, like acronyms?  There is no need for apostrophes indicating a plural on capitalized letters, numbers and symbols.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Quotation marks %}}
Below are examples of correctly punctuated quotations:

* “Would you like a banana?” he asked.
* “I hate bananas,” she said. “You know I hate bananas.”
* He paused before saying, “Bananas are not something people should hate.”

Quotation marks should NOT be used to indicate emphasis or emotion, nor should they be used to set off proper names.

* **Example:** Get ready for hurricane season.
  * NOT: Get ready for “hurricane season.”
* **Example:** We are currently understaffed but we will do our best to get to your concern in a timely manner.
  * NOT: We are currently understaffed but we will “do our best” to get to your concern in a timely manner.
* **Example:** Joe Johnson became the head of the Department of Human Affairs in June 1999.
  * NOT: Joe Johnson became the head of the “Department of Human Affairs” in June 1999.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Semicolons %}}
Use semicolons at the end of bullet points.

* **Example:** Acceptable forms of identification include:
  * Driver’s license;
  * Birth certificate;
  * Or Social Security card.
{{% /filter-item %}}


{{% filter-item White space %}}
Whenever possible, use lots of white space. White space, or negative space, is the unmarked parts of a page, including the space between lines, columns, and images. Break up walls of text and keep paragraphs at four sentences or less to ensure sufficient white space.
