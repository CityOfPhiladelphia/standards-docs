Site-wide alerts are only used for weather and safety emergencies. Site-wide alerts appear on every page of the site as part of the header. They should be used sparingly so they have real impact every time they are used.

Site-wide alerts consist of:

 * A headline stating the kind of emergency.
 * A subhead containing an instruction and a link for more information.
 * A third line with information on how long this will be in effect, if known.

The format for how long something will be in effect is:

In effect: 6:30 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 9 to noon on Saturday, Sept. 10

**or**

In effect: Friday, Sept. 9 to Saturday, Sept. 10
