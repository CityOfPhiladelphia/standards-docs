 Donâ€™t post a pdf version of a document unless it needs to be printed.
PDFs:

* Are hard to read on computer and mobile screens.
* Require extra software to use.
* Are not always accessible to people with disabilities.
* Cannot be shared on social media.

Usability expert Jakob Nielsen explains that PDFs are good for distributing documents and forms that need to be printed, but nothing else. No matter how much you might want to, **never use a PDF for content that you want users to read online.**
