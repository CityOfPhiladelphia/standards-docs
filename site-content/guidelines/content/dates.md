**Use numbers for dates and years.** Don't use *st, nd, rd,* or *th*.  Write out the name of months. When you use months with a date, only abbreviate the following months: Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov. and Dec.

>We'll start on Sept. 12 and finish by the end of November.
The parade will take place on July 4.

You don't need to use a comma if  only a year and month are given (e.g., December 2016), but commas should be used to set off a year if the date, month, and year are given. 
>Philadelphia was founded on October 27, 1682.

Capitalize days of the week, but do not abbreviate.

>Mayor Kenney will be speaking at the event on Thursday.

### Time-date-place
The preferred structure for conveying event information in narrative text is time-date-place.

>The press conference will be held at 2 p.m., Jan. 25 at the Municipal Services Building.

Use of the day of the week is optional. If the day is included, it should be spelled out.

>The press conference will be held at 2 p.m., Saturday, Jan. 25 at the Municipal Services Building.

### Times
When specific times are important to include, use numbers. Use a.m. and p.m. for morning and afternoon. Use noon and midnight to avoid confusion about 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. Use a colon to separate hours and minutes, but don't use a colon for something that occurs on the hour.
