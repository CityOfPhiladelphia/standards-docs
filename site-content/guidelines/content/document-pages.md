On a document page, one or more related files can be downloaded by users. These pages prevent users and departments from having lots of stray links to files that are difficult to find and update.

A document page should contain:

#A heading
What are these documents? Include if they are forms, instructions, regulations, applications, etc.

#Context
One or more paragraphs of text providing some context for the documents. What are they related to? Who would use them? Be sure to link back to relevant pages that will give more necessary information.

#A list of files that can be downloaded
The files have a name, a description, a release date, and file type displayed. Users can search in any of those fields to find the files they need, and to see how recently the file has been updated.

**Always link to a document page instead of right to the file.** The document pages provide context for users, and are reviewed and updated regularly. If a PDF gets deleted a link right to that file will stop working, but the document page will still be there with information and the latest version of a form or document.
