Spell out numbers one through nine; use numerals beyond that (10, 11, etc.). Spell out a number when it:

* Occurs at the start of a sentence. (*Twenty minutes later, the last cyclist crossed the finish line.*)
* Is a fraction used as an estimate. (*one-half, two-thirds, three-quarters*)

Use digits instead of spelling out a number when it:

* Includes a decimal point. (*At that time, the average age for marriage was just 18.7 years old.*)
* Is part of a percentage. (*19 percent of registered voters; 110% effort*)
* Is part of a range of numbers. (*the coveted 18--34 demographic; working 9 to 5*)

### Phone and fax numbers
Use parentheses and a space to separate the area code from the rest of a phone or fax number. Use a hyphen (-) between the third and fourth digits that follow the area code.

>Call (215) 686-0306 to find out if the building where you live is being managed by a court-appointed receiver.  
You can pay delinquent property taxes with a credit card by calling (877) 309-3710.

### Money
Use the dollar sign ($) for amounts given in United States Dollars (USD).

>Project estimates are expected to exceed $289.5 million after the storm damage is assessed.  
Previous processing fee: $0.72  
New processing fee: $0.83  

For fractional amounts under $1.00 that do not occur in a chart or list, use digits for the number and spell out the word "cents."

>In 2014, the cost of producing a penny dropped to 1.7 cents, down from 2.4 cents in 2011.

### Percentages
Spell out the word "percent" (one word) when including percentages in prose writing.

>The study showed a 5 percent decrease in obesity rates among students aged 5 to 18.

Use the percentage sign (%) when including percentages in charts, lists, and brief summaries.

>Late fee: 5% of the total due, plus an additional 0.5% for every month the bill is not paid.
