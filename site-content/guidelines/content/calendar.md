Use Google calendar to set up your calendar events.

Use the [Dates] (https://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/standards-docs/guidelines/content/dates/) section of the Content Style Guide to check your use of date, time, place, and abbreviations.

All-day events taking place on the same day should be entered all together.
Use an ampersand (&) before the last item in the list, and use a serial comma.

Example: *Monthly payment due for Wage, Hotel, Outdoor Advertising, Parking, Valet Parking, & Vehicle Rental Taxes*
