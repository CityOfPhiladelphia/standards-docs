Use active voice, not passive voice, whenever possible.

**Active voice** makes it immediately clear who or what is performing an action.

>*The mayor recommends* that City residents take shelter before the winter storm.

**Passive voice** describes a sentence that doesn't state who or what is responsible for an action, or puts the "do-er" later in the sentence than the thing being done.

>*It is recommended* that City residents take shelter before the winter storm.

>A recommendation *was made by the mayor* to take shelter before the winter storm.

While readers usually prefer active voice, there are situations where passive voice is useful. This includes times when the acting person or thing is actually unknown, or when you want to draw attention to the object being acted upon.

>The motorcycles *were stolen* late last night.  
**--NOT--**  
*Someone stole* the motorcycles late last night.

### Address readers actively
You are also using active voice when you speak directly to the reader. This style is more interesting to read. Use active voice in situations where it's appropriate to encourage action instead of just stating a fact.

>*You can create* a new community garden if there is a City-owned vacant lot in your neighborhood.  
**--NOT--**  
New community gardens *can be created* in City-owned vacant lots.
