{{% filter-item Block capitalization %}}
DON’T USE CAPITAL LETTERS FOR LONGER HEADLINES OR BLOCKS OF TEXT. IT’S HARD TO READ AND CAN SEEM LIKE “SHOUTING.”
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Block quotes %}}
Use block quotes when you want to highlight a single sentence or phrase from within the body of your writing. Block quotes use text format and placement to highlight a particular issue so readers who scan can get the most important nugget from the story. Use block quotes sparingly to create the biggest impact.

* **Example:**
“We are changing the way the City website serves our residents” - Office of Open Data and Digital Transformation

{{% filter-item Emphasis %}}
**Bold** calls attention to key information.

_Italics_ are used under specific conditions, such as to indicate the title of a book. Avoid using italics to emphasize an idea or to create a sarcastic tone.

Underlining should not be used in web communications, as this can be reserved to indicate a link.

{{% filter-item Calendar %}}
Use Google calendar to set up your calendar events.
Use the [Dates]section of the common usage guide to check your use of date, time, place, and abbreviations.
All-day events taking place on the same day should be entered all together. Use an ampersand (&) before the last item in the list, and do not use a serial comma.

* **Example:** Monthly payment due for Wage, Hotel, Outdoor Advertising, Parking, Valet Parking & Vehicle Rental Taxes
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Headings %}}
Use Headings to break up content into sections. Headlines, page titles, subheads, and similar content should follow sentence capitalization rules.

* **Example:** How to pay your taxes.
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Headlines %}}
Headlines should be unique, specific and short, conveying the most important point of the piece. Treat headlines as sentences without ending punctuation by including verbs. Only capitalize proper nouns. Use the present and active voice. Use commas instead of “and” or “&.”

* **Example:*** Ways to pay, options for residents of Philadelphia
{{% /filter-item %}}

{{% filter-item Justification %}}
For written languages that read left to right, left justification is most appropriate for bodies of text. Center justification should be used sparingly. For written languages that read right to left, right justification is most appropriate for bodies of text. Be consistent. Never mix justifications within a document.

{{% filter-item Links %}}
Links are most effective when they are specific and descriptive. When you create a link, highlight text that will give users a clear idea of what they will see if they follow the link. This is especially useful for people with vision impairments who use screen readers, and will often skip from one link to another as a way of skimming content.

* **Example:** To be ready for the unexpected, you and your family need to [make an emergency plan](https://beta.phila.gov/services/safety-emergency-preparedness/prepare-for-an-emergency/make-an-emergency-plan/).
  * NOT: To be ready for the unexpected, you can find out how to create an emergency plan [here](https://beta.phila.gov/services/safety-emergency-preparedness/prepare-for-an-emergency/make-an-emergency-plan/).

#### No “click here”

Do not use “click here” as the label for any link. Since “click here” is not descriptive, it’s harder for people to find the linked content through a search engine. It’s also becoming an outdated term, since mobile devices involve tapping, not clicking.

#### Link destinations

When you create a link, think about where you are sending the user and why. Check to make sure that you have picked the most relevant and authoritative destination so users will get the best information available as quickly as possible. For example, if the Department of Health issues a statement that you are citing, link to the Health statement, rather than to an outside news story that quotes the statement.

You should also be consistent when determining what will happen when someone follows a link. Phila.gov follows these guidelines for opening new tabs or windows in a user’s browser:

#### Do not automatically open new tabs or windows
Do not set a link to open a new browser tab or window. This applies to any web page link, whether the link goes to another phila.gov page or to an external website.*

* Example: For additional information on emergency preparedness and response measures, visit the <a href="https://www.fema.gov/" class="external">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)</a> website.

#### Do automatically open new tabs if the link will begin a process
If the link will begin a new process (for example, starting a registration process for a license, paying a bill, or ordering something), do set the link to open in a new tab. This allows people to complete that new process while still referencing the original page.

#### Link to document pages, not directly to PDFs
When linking to a form or document, link to the document page that houses that form, rather than directly to the form. Document pages provide important context for files, group related forms together, and are regularly reviewed and updated.


#### Indicate when linking to a website outside of phila.gov
When you are linking to a website outside of phila.gov check the box that indicates that this website is not part of phila.gov. This helps users know they’ll be going to a new website, not a different page on phila.gov. For more information visit [technical details on linking](/use/technical-details/css-architecture/#class-names).

#### Repetitive links
Excessive linking can be confusing and overwhelming. If a resource, topic, or organization is referenced multiple times on one page you only need to link to it the first time. For example, if you refer to the Office of Property Assessment three times in a content item, link to it the first time but not the second or third times.

{{% filter-item Lists %}}

There are two types of lists: bulleted and numbered. Bulleted lists are known as “unordered” on the web, and numbered lists are known as “ordered.” Most lists should be unordered. Only use an ordered list if the order or number of items matters, as in a list of steps.

{{% filter-item PDFs %}}
Usability expert Jakob Nielsen explains that [PDFs are good for distributing documents and forms that need to be printed] (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pdf-unfit-for-human-consumption/). However, PDFs have several limitations.

PDFs are:

* Hard to read on computer and mobile screens.
* Not always accessible to people with disabilities.
* Not easily shared on social media.

For these reasons, PDFs shouldn’t be used for content that you want people to read online. If you have many PDFs, you should store them on a Document page (see HOW TO MAKE A DOCMENT PAGE)

{{% filter-item White space %}}
Whenever possible, use lots of white space. White space, or negative space, is the unmarked parts of a page, including the space between lines, columns, and images. Break up walls of text and keep paragraphs at four sentences or less to ensure sufficient white space.
