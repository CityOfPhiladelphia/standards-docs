Carefully considered photography brings another dimension to the City’s brand identity. Pictures should be expressive, show real people and emotions, and be cropped for greatest effect. Aim for a photojournalistic approach, creating a sense of place, and showing real-life interactions between people. Never use a photo that’s contrived or cliched. Dynamic lines, angles and cropping give images personality.


Guidelines:  

1. Images must be at least 300 dpi  
2. Must use imagery that is not visibly dated  
3. Must be images that have been taken in Philadelphia  
4. No cell phone pictures  
5. Add photo credit where photo credit is due

## Implementation
All images are required to have alternate text. Good alternate text describes the image in its surrounding context. If an image contains text, that text must be the alternate text. If the image is purely visual and does not contain meaningful information, the alternate text can be blank, but the attribute must be present.

You can read more about alternate text on the <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" class="external">WebAIM website</a>.
