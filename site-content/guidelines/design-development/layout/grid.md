The grid system is composed of 24 columns. It is the foundation on which all site layouts are built. Grids can be nested if needed. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with grid systems, [this document](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html) will provide more information.

## Implementation
Add a `row` class on a div. Inside the row class, add `columns`. Pair the `columns` class with a breakpoint and a width. Example: The classes `columns medium-12` will render a 12 column (or 50% width) div on medium size screens and up. You can use `small-#`, `medium-#`, and `large-#`.
