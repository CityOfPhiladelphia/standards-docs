Phila.gov uses three types of menus to organize information.

### Global navigation
The global navigation is the unifying element across all phila.gov pages. It is used to help users orient themselves in the site architecture and provides them with access to all major areas of the phila.gov website. It should be present on every page.

### Secondary menu

Department and application websites sometimes require their own set of internal navigation. Items in this menu may or may not have subpages.

### Side navigation
Content may be so nuanced that a third level of navigation is required.  It consists of third and fourth level pages that are not appropriate to display at the second level.
