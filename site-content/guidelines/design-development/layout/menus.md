Phila.gov uses three types of menus to organize information.

### Global navigation

The global navigation is the unifying element across all phila.gov pages. The global navigation consists of the services drop-down menu and the search function, which help users orient themselves in the site architecture and provide them with access to all major areas of the phila.gov website. It should be present on every page and should be sticky, so that it remains available, even as people scroll. 

We are working on improving menu implementation for global navigation across external sites. 


### Secondary menu

The secondary menu features top-level pages that can provide access to third-level navigation. Currently, the secondary level only functions as labels if subsidiary content is present. Secondary menus often function as a directory within an individual department's site. 


### Side navigation
The majority of a siteâ€™s information architecture will likely be presented through side navigation. In beta, the services are presented through the tertiary menu. Content may be so nuanced that a fourth level of navigation is required.
