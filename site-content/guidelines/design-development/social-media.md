The branding that you use on your department’s social media profiles should align with the City’s branding that we use on phila.gov. The brand should be reflected in your profile pictures, icons, header images and other imagery. For consistency, your header image should always match with the header image on your department site. Your profile picture can be your logo if you have one.

## Implementation

In addition to the visual guidelines, all phila.gov pages should use open graph meta tags. You can change the base image if it is appropriate to do so, like in the case of a blog or news post that contains other images. In most cases, however, the default phila.gov open graph image in the above example is sufficient.
