The global header provides the City logo, site-wide navigation, and search functionality. The footer has two parts. The first footer provides 311 information. The second footer links to community resources, city government, and social media.

## Implementation

Use the [boilerplate](/templates/markup/boilerplate/) markup to implement the global header.

The global header should be sticky when the user scrolls down the page. If you have included the standards styles, javascript files, and used the markup above, the header should function out-of-the-box. Do not modify the markup.

This portion of the Digital Standards is still a work in progress.
