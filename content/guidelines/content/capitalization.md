Unnecessary capitalization can come off as overly formal and unapproachable. We follow these capitalization guidelines:  

  - Don't capitalize *federal* or *government*
  - Don't capitalize a job title unless it directly precedes or follows a name

## Proper nouns
Capitalize the word "city" when referring to the City of Philadelphia as an official organization.

>The City will announce pool openings on Friday.

There are several City employees at the event.
Do not capitalize "city" when it is used in an inclusive or general sense.

>Philadelphia has been selected as the host city for the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

## Headings
Headlines, page titles, subheads, and similar content should follow normal sentence capitalization.

>Making sense of Washington’s tech landscape

>Privileges and responsibilities

## Block capitalization
DON'T USE CAPITAL LETTERS FOR LONGER HEADLINES OR BLOCKS OF TEXT. IT'S HARD TO READ AND CAN SEEM LIKE "SHOUTING."
