Links are most effective when they are specific and descriptive. When you create a link, highlight text that will give users a clear idea of what they will see if they follow it. This is especially useful for people with vision impairment who use screen readers, and will often [skip from one link to another](http://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/#link_to_link) as a way of skimming content.

## No "click here"
Do not use "click here" as the label for any link. Since "click here" is not descriptive, it's harder for people to find the linked content through a search engine. It's also becoming an outdated term, since mobile devices involve tapping, not clicking.

## Link destinations
When you create a link, think about where you are sending the user and why. Check to make sure that you have picked the most relevant and authoritative destination so users will get the best information available as quickly as possible. For example, if the Department of Health issues a statement that you are citing, link to the Health statement, rather than to an outside news story that quotes the statement.

You should also be consistent when determining what will happen when someone follows a link. Phila.gov follows these guidelines for opening new tabs or windows in a user’s browser:

### Do not automatically open new tabs or windows

Do not set a link to open a new browser tab or window. This applies to any web page link, whether the link goes to another phila.gov page or to an external website.*

>*For additional information on emergency preparedness and response measures, visit the <a href="https://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)</a> website.*

### Do automatically open new tabs if the link will begin a process

If the link will begin a new process (for example, starting a registration process for a license, paying a bill, or ordering something) do set the link to open in a new tab. This allows people to complete that new process while still referencing the original page.

### Link to document pages, not right to pdfs

When linking to a form or document, link to the document page that houses that form, rather than directly to the form. Document pages provide important context for files, group related forms together, and are regularly reviewed and updated.

### Indicate when linking to a website outside of phila.gov

When you are linking to a website outside of phila.gov check the box that indicates that this website is not part of phila.gov. This helps users know they’ll be going to a new website, not a different page on phila.gov.

### Repetitive links
Excessive linking can be confusing and overwhelming. If a resource, topic, or organization is referenced multiple times on one page you only need to link to it the first time. For example, if you refer to the [Office of Property Assessment](http://www.phila.gov/opa/Pages/default.aspx) three times in a content item, link to it the first time but not the second or third times.

*[Opinions](https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/) do [vary](http://uxmovement.com/navigation/why-external-links-should-open-in-new-tabs/) on the [subject](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/19892/opening-website-external-links-in-new-window-published-usability-tests), but there is [not much evidence](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/01/should-links-open-in-new-windows/) to suggest that people want a new tab or window to open automatically when they click a link to an external site. Having many tabs or windows open at the same time can be confusing to users if they have not chosen to see content this way. Users who do want new tabs to open still have this ability, since modern browsers support macros and controls that allow them to open any link in a new tab or window.
