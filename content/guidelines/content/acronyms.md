**Acronyms can confuse readers. Whenever possible, use the full name.**

The first time you refer to an organization or project that uses an acronym, write out the full name and follow with the abbreviation in parentheses.

>The General Services Administration (GSA) oversees the business of the U.S. Federal Government.

Some names are more recognizable when they are abbreviated, as with *NASA*, *NAACP*, *IBM*, and *FBI*. In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable.

## Use "nicknames" in your second reference

It's often clearer to use a shortened name instead of an acronym when making a second reference to something with a long title. Readers can understand a shortened name without having to think about the first reference. This also helps prevent confusion between repetitive acronyms.

> Use *Commerce* in place of *Department of Commerce*, rather than *DOC*.

>Use *Corrections* in place of *Department of Corrections*, rather than *DOC*.

>Use *the Act* instead of *Fire and Police Employee Relations Act*.
