Government writing tends to be dry, complicated, and obscure. It doesn't take into account who is reading it or why, and often talks at readers rather than to them.

Likewise, many government websites provide an overwhelming amount of information with few cues on how to navigate it. This can cause confusion, frustration, and a feeling of powerlessness for readers.

We think Philadelphia can do better.

We want to make government services more accessible and understandable to everyday citizens. We want to give people the information they need, to do what they need, in a way that fosters trust. This guide can help you achieve those goals.
